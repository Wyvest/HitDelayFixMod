# HitDelayFixMod

A forge mod for minecraft 1.8 that sets leftClickCounter to 0 after a MISS, therefore fixing the hit delay problem in 1.8.

The master branch is the clean version with just the fix, the debug branch has a version which has some commands to show hit/miss information in chat. Download links for both are available on the website [here](https://ghast.io/hitdelayfixmod).
